\description{
These functions calculate the distance between:
\itemize{
    \item A first spline characterized by two points.
    \item A second set of two splines characterized by the same two points,
    plus an additional point between the first two.
}
They also calculate the derivative of that distance with respect to the
coordinates of the additional point.
