\description{
These functions calculate the distance between:
\itemize{
    \item A first spline characterized by two points.
    \item A second set of three splines characterized by the same two points,
    plus two additional points between the first two.
}
They also calculate the derivative of that distance with respect to the
coordinates of the additionals points.
